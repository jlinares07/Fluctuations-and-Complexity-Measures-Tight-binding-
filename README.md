# Fluctuations-and-Complexity-Measures-Tight-binding-

This repository contains the reference implementation and codes built to present our results in "Fluctuations, Complexity and Statistical Measures for Particles in a Tight-Binding Lattice".

You could find the Python 3.9.25 files that we used to build Figures 3 and 4. 
In Figure 3, we present the system in a distributed way, following that -M ≤ l+m ≤ M, with M=3. The codes used to obtain that are named "dloc1.py" and "dloc2.py", such codes corresponds to without interaction (U=0.0) and with interaction (U=100λ=1.0), respectively. The output are those Delocalized_v2(...).npz files
